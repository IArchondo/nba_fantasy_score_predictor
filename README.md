# NBA Fantasy Score Predictor 

After winning my friends' fantasy league in the 2018-19 season, things did not 
go so well in the season immediately after that. Currently I am out of the playoffs
and sliding downward. 

To prove to them that the end of my glorious run as the league's best gm was just 
due to a large series of unfortunate barely foreseeable and even less probable events,
I have decided to create a tool that will be able to take any given fantasy matchup
and predict winning probabilities for each of the two teams. 

In order to do that I will model a player's future performance based on their 
past games, creating a performance distribution. Adding all these predictions,
I will be able to simulate matchup outcomes and find an overall outcome distribution.

With this project, I will try to enhance my knowledge of:
- web scraping
- the NBA API
- modeling past behavior
- Probability distribution
- Simulation
- Poisson
